# Basics

The Albatross language has some builtin types and builtin functions. The
compiler is aware of these types/functions. However all builtins are defined
within some modules of the Albatross base library. The following modules
contain builtins

- boolean
- any
- predicate
- function
- tuple
- list

It is assumed that all or some of these modules are used heavily in
application modules. Therefore in this chapter we give an overview of these
modules.
