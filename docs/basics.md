# Basics

The Albatross language has some builtin types and builtin functions. The
compiler is aware of these types/functions. However all builtins are defined
within some modules of the Albatross base library. The following modules
contain builtins

- boolean
- any
- predicate
- function
- tuple
- list

It is assumed that all or some of these modules are used heavily in
application modules. Therefore in this chapter we give an overview of these
modules.

We describe the types and the most important functions. We do describe
the theorems of these modules. They can be read by reading the interface
files. The information on types and functions given in the following chapters
is sufficient to understand the theorems.

The chapters [Theorems and Proofs](theorems.md) and [Proof
Engine](proof_engine.md) cover the aspects of theorems and proofs especially
the aspect of writing and understanding proofs.
